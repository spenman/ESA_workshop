This is a text file to remind me how to commit things to git

- Make some great changes to my file/code/whatever

- SAVE the file

- Open the git window on the top right of my Rstudio pane

- Tick the box next to the object I want to save with git

-  hit the "commit" button on the git pane

- check what has changed as differences since the last version will be highlighted

- add a descriptive commit message of what I changed/did

- hit commit

- then try again to break my code as I have an awesome copy saved


(to change the email address used by the following line in the terminal:

git config --global user.email"spenman1@student.unimelb.edu.au")
